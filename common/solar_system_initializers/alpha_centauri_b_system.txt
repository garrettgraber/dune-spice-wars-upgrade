# This is a full example of system initializers and initializer trees
# A system initializer is used to initialize each solar system in the game by creating planets, setting names and values on everything.
# The system also has a tree structure that allows one initializer decide how neighboring systems should be initialized ( see the 'neighbor_system' part further down ).
#
# All numeric values can be scripted as 'x = 10' or 'x = { min = 5 max = 15 }', except within the triggers and effects
#
# Useful console commands:
# 'Draw.Clusters' will toggle clusters on/off. Some clusters are created in the beginning and will be used for placing empires. Clusters can(will) also be created from effects and events
# 'Draw.SystemInit' will print the initializer used for each system, as well as lines to show which initializer triggered another

	#usage = misc_system_init	#game can pick this initializer randomly when initializing misc systems. i.e systems that have not been initialized by empires or fallen empires
	#you can specify multiple usages for an initializer.
	#By not specifiying any usage the game won't use this initializer except when explicitly told to from another script ( if a prescripted species or an effect specify an initializer by name )

	#when all planets have been created and the system is initialized the init_effect will be executed
	#you can use this to spawn mining drones etc
	#the scope will be a galactic_object scope, with prev being set to the previous system that was initialized by this tree ( if any ). Root will point to the first system in the tree.
