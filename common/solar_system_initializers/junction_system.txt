# This is a full example of system initializers and initializer trees
# A system initializer is used to initialize each solar system in the game by creating planets, setting names and values on everything.
# The system also has a tree structure that allows one initializer decide how neighboring systems should be initialized ( see the 'neighbor_system' part further down ).
#
# All numeric values can be scripted as 'x = 10' or 'x = { min = 5 max = 15 }', except within the triggers and effects
#
# Useful console commands:
# 'Draw.Clusters' will toggle clusters on/off. Some clusters are created in the beginning and will be used for placing empires. Clusters can(will) also be created from effects and events
# 'Draw.SystemInit' will print the initializer used for each system, as well as lines to show which initializer triggered another


junction_system_initializer = {
	name = "Junction"						#Name of the system.
	class = "sc_g"								#system's star class. [random] picks a random class from all available system classes. ["name_of_class"] picks a specific class. ["name_of_random_list"] picks a random class from the specified random_list ( random_list are found in the same files as the star classes )

	#Initializers can specify how the game can use them.
	#valid values are:
	#usage = empire_init		#game can pick this initializer randomly to initialize systems for regular empires ( i.e the player(s) or regular AI empires ) that do not specify a specific initializer
	#usage = misc_system_init	#game can pick this initializer randomly when initializing misc systems. i.e systems that have not been initialized by empires or fallen empires
	#you can specify multiple usages for an initializer.
	#By not specifiying any usage the game won't use this initializer except when explicitly told to from another script ( if a prescripted species or an effect specify an initializer by name )
	#usage_odds = 20				#if a 'usage = x' is specified the usage_odds is used to control the odds of this initializer being picked over another.
	max_instances = 1			#This initializer can at most be used 1 time. leave blank or negative for infinite. Note that this limit is also applied when spawning systems from effects, i.e if the galaxy starts with 9 instances you can only create 1 system with this initializer from effects.
	#when all planets have been created and the system is initialized the init_effect will be executed
	#you can use this to spawn mining drones etc
	#the scope will be a galactic_object scope, with prev being set to the previous system that was initialized by this tree ( if any ). Root will point to the first system in the tree.
