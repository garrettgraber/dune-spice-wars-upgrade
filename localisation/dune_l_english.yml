EMPIRE_DESIGN_rayki:0 "House Rayki"
EMPIRE_DESIGN_rayki_desc:0 "According to historical records House Rayki is formed by descendants of Celtic clans from Old Earth, always maintaining a strict code of conduct about diluting the line they have kept their ancestral genetics virtually intact with only the smallest ammount of genetic engineering. \n\nThe House Rayki began it's rise to power late in the Imperial Calendar and have only now achieved the position of House Major with the chance to operate planetary fiefs, as an added bonus they have been gifted Old Earth to guard and preserve, a sacred place with incalculable resources. \n\nThe House Rayki is determined to achieve unity and bring all other Houses under a consolidated form of government, unknown to the Golden Lion Throne."

EMPIRE_DESIGN_atreides:0 "House Atreides"
EMPIRE_DESIGN_atreides_desc:0 "The legend stated that the Atreides family came from a noble family that originated in Greece on Earth, and that they rose to prominence during the Butlerian Jihad. They claimed to descent from King Agamemnon, a son of Atreus, in Greek mythology. The descendants of Atreus are called "Atreides". \n\nThis Royal House had perfected a form of government that resulted in a well-organized society and a spiritually satisfied people. Furthermore, House Atreides kept Caladan a lush, prosperous paradise with relatively low industrial levels. \n\nThe House was also proficient in war; it maintained Swordmasters, Warmasters and Mentats to train and lead their army, and had even developed its own Battle Language."

EMPIRE_DESIGN_harkonnen:0 "House Harkonnen"
EMPIRE_DESIGN_harkonnen_desc:0 "After many centuries as a House Minor, Harkonnen influence gradually rose within the Landsraad, due mostly to shrewd manipulation of the whale fur market, thanks to the efforts of Baron Dmitri Harkonnen and his son Vladimir. \n\nThey built its power by maximizing production output and minimizing their expenses, ignoring economically ethical behaviour. \n\nHarkonnen governing is based upon a simple foundation of fear and terror. They are used in governance, in the day-to-day running of the Harkonnen household, and in controlling the Harkonnen armies. \n\nWith a social order based on treachery and punishment, soldiers rose through the ranks through deceit, trickery and, if necessary, assassination."

EMPIRE_DESIGN_corrino:0 "House Corrino"
EMPIRE_DESIGN_corrino_desc:0 "The events after the Battle of Corrin saw the newly formed House Corrino capture rulership of the new Imperium, maintaining a firm grip on the Empire over the subsequent millennia. \n\nDuring their Imperial rule, House Corrino maintained arguably the most powerful army in the known universe, the Sardaukar. Formed by prisoners from Salusa Secundus, their superior abilities were capable of crushing any military opposition. It was said that only the combined forces of all the Great Houses of the Landsraad could defeat such incredible force. \n\nTo keep their seat in the throne, they will backstab and use treacherous tactics, but without getting openly involved, using other houses to make their dirt work."

EMPIRE_DESIGN_fremen:0 "Fremen"
EMPIRE_DESIGN_fremen_desc:0 "To the Fremen, the fight for survival had long dominated their cultural identity. Descendants from the Zensunni Wanderers, these people had to adapt to the brutal environment of Arrakis and his frugal use of energy and resources, especially water. \n\nAdditionally, their history with cultural persecution mandated the need for combat knowledge, creating a group of efficient and hardy warriors, who used their skills and the environment of Arrakis to fend off off-world opponents who often possessed superior technology and training. \n\nWater plays a vital role in the Fremen culture, a representation of life itself. When one of then dies, his water is removed from their body and returned to the tribe."

EMPIRE_DESIGN_benegesserit:0 "Bene Gesserit Sisterhood"
EMPIRE_DESIGN_benegesserit_desc:0 "The origins of the Bene Gesserit are widely unknown at a point that the only verifiable fact is that the Bene Gesserit arose during the political turmoil that followed the Butlerian Jihad, quickly establishing themselves as an influential political force among other houses. \n\nFor millennia, the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood chose to exercise its power by acting in the background of imperial politics, through their breeding program, their placement of agents in the imperial court and Great Houses and their provision of services such as the mediation in disputes and overseers of negotiations. \n\nTheir real agenda, however, is far from completion and just a handful of people truly understands their final goal."

EMPIRE_DESIGN_guild:0 "Spacing Guild"
EMPIRE_DESIGN_guild_desc:0 "Details of the Guild's emergence are contentious, although it is believed they emerged as a serious political and economic force around the time of The Great Convention. \n\nThe Spacing Guild was by its very nature a secretive organization that took up functions previously covered by the Thinking Machines, just as Mentats and the Bene Gesserit did. \n\nTheir very existence rests on the proprietary knowledge of folding space, the only reliable method of traveling among the stars. \n\nThe inner structure of the Guild is a well keep mystery, even for nobles of the Great Houses. The role of Guild Navigator is the most prestigious part inside the organization, although just a few know where they really come from."

EMPIRE_DESIGN_bene_tleilaxu:0 "Bene Tleilaxu"
EMPIRE_DESIGN_bene_tleilaxu_desc:0 "The Bene Tleilax or Tleilaxu are an extremely xenophobic and isolationist society. Genetic manipulators who traffic in biological products such as artificial eyes, gholas, and "twisted" Mentats, the Tleilaxu are a major power in the Imperium.\n\nThe race is ruled by a small council of Tleilaxu Masters, whose genetically-engineered Face Dancer servants have the ability to mimic any human. The Masters themselves possess a bland and diminutive appearance intended to compel other races to underestimate them. Despite their influence, the Bene Tleilax are universally distrusted and inspire disgust because their products, though desirable, push the limits of the moral proscriptions established by the ancient Butlerian Jihad."

EMPIRE_DESIGN_ginaz:0 "House Ginaz"
EMPIRE_DESIGN_ginaz_desc:0 "The Ginaz family traces its origins to the Ginaztera Company, a troupe of entertainers working the Richelieu Sector during the time of Fredhrick V, who made Alberto Ginaztera a noble.\n\nThe House of Ginaz had a monopoly on live performances before audiences of 10,000 or more, and it also owned chains of gambling casinos, prostitution rings catering to the very rich, and theatres specializing in fights between different kinds of animals, or between animals and humans.\n\nIn addition, during the time of the Faufreluches, Ginaz was famed for its training of Swordmasters in dedicated schools. Swordmasters of Ginaz were regarded superior warriors in every way, superior even to a Sardaukar."

EMPIRE_DESIGN_moritani:0 "House Moritani"
EMPIRE_DESIGN_moritani_desc:0 "House Moritani was a House Major during the time of the Faufreluches. Their ancestral home was the planet Grumman. House Moritani had a long-standing feud with House Ginaz, which eventually saw the latter defeated in the War of Assassins of 10,187 AG. House Moritani was a wild card that doesn't follow accepted rules. They especially don't follow the Emperor's orders."

EMPIRE_DESIGN_omnius:0 "Synchronised Worlds"
EMPIRE_DESIGN_omnius_desc:0 "Omnius, also known as the Evermind, was a collection of powerful artificially intelligent entities, which existed prior to and during the Butlerian Jihad, and after in the refounded Synchronized Worlds outside the Old Empire.\n\nThough Omnius instances existed on many worlds, each one evolving subtle differences, all instances were bound by a synchronizing process that saw them share the collective experiences of their counterparts. Thus they were frequently referred to as a single being.\n\nOmnius is often cited as the cause of the mankind's long-standing revulsion of technology, particularly computers. Though technically a gender-less being, speech refers to Omnius as a male."

EMPIRE_DESIGN_richese:0 "House Richese"
EMPIRE_DESIGN_richese_desc:0 "House Richese was a Great House during the time of the Faufreluches. They were onetime allies of House Atreides.\n\nHouse Richese was known throughout the Imperium for the manufacture of machines. A rivalry existed between House Richese and House Vernius for the honour of being major supplier of technology to the Imperium. It was, however, generally accepted that House Vernius, on the planet of Ix, typically produced superior machines to the Richesians."

EMPIRE_DESIGN_vernius:0 "House Vernius"
EMPIRE_DESIGN_vernius_desc:0 "A relatively young great house, House Vernius was only a few centuries old by the time the Leto Atreides I became Duke of their Faufreluches ally, House Atreides. A fire red ruby ring from Hagal was the sign of their Earl.\n\nHouse Vernius specialized in technological innovations. After an intense economic war with House Richese, they won the right to manufacture the lucrative Heighliners for the Spacing Guild."

EMPIRE_DESIGN_ecaz:0 "House Ecaz"
EMPIRE_DESIGN_ecaz_desc:0 "House Ecaz rules the fourth planet of Alpha Centauri B, also named Ecaz. During the events of Prelude to Dune and the interquel novel Paul of Dune (2008), the head of the House is Archduke Armand Ecaz; at this time, House Ecaz is in kanly, or vendetta, with House Moritani.\n\nThe planet Ecaz was known as the sculptors paradise, because of the fogwood, a plant growth capable of being shaped by the power of human thought. Also producing the elacca, semuta, verite and sapho drugs."

EMPIRE_DESIGN_ezharian:0 "House Ezharian"
EMPIRE_DESIGN_ezharian_desc:0 "The ancestral home planet of House Ezharian, Enif IV, is a wonderful winter paradise. A beautifully mountainous terrain, combined with narrow tropical ocean climate near the equatorial latitudes has made Enif IV a playground for the affluent in the Imperium, at one time even attracting a young Shaddam IV to its resorts before his ascention to the throne.\n\nTowering mountains and snow covered valleys about all of the planet almost mandated the revival of the ancient pastimes of skiing and snow sports, which are the planet's primary attraction. Of course these same mountains and alpine like forests make Enif IV a dangerous world to assault, and the Enifians have over many centuries become very efficient in fighting through the heavy tundra and alpine forest terrain, making many think twice before assaulting the world.\n\nEarliest record of House Ezharian stretches back to several generations before the Butlerian Jihad (201 B.G.), over 85 generations have since passed. House Ezharian is chiefly remembered for its shelter of political dissidents on both sides within its borders, and for smuggling these dissidents beyond the reach of the persecution, and even, according to rumor, arranging transport to Tupile or one of the other shelter planets."

EMPIRE_DESIGN_nebiro:0 "House Wayku"
EMPIRE_DESIGN_nebiro_desc:0 "House Wayku was a House Major that became disgraced sometime prior to the rule of Emperor Shaddam Corrino IV.\n\nDuring the Third Coalsack War all of House Wayku's planets were destroyed and thus it was left homeless, and prohibited from setting foot on any world in the Imperium. However, unlike other fallen houses which were banished to Tupile, for unknown reasons House Wayku found a home and employment with the Spacing Guild?, who sub-contracted them to run mass-transit vehicles housed on board Guild Heighliners as nomads who tended to the customers selling sizzling meat sticks, spicy-salty broths, & a potent drink called stee.\n\nThey were seen wearing dark glasses and ear-clamp headsets. They managed to live in their own sensory cacophony preferring the universe within to any spectacle they might experience outside."

EMPIRE_DESIGN_khumali:0 "House Khumali"
EMPIRE_DESIGN_khumali_desc:0 "Sa'ad Khumali was Landsraad president and in 1604 AG became Emperor.\n\nBy 10134 AG the House encountered some issues concerning the succession of its head. To decide, a special panel was convened by Elrood IX with Minotauros Atreides as one of the members."

EMPIRE_DESIGN_tantor:0 "House Tantor"
EMPIRE_DESIGN_tantor_desc:0 "House Tantor was a House Major that used Atomics against House Corrino and they destroyed Salusa Secundus in the 2nd Millenium AG. For that reason the Imperial capital had to be moved to Kaitain. Emperor Hassik Corrino III lashed out against House Tantor, and declared that the family had to be wiped out. The House had been all but obliterated.\n\nSome of the descendants of House Tantor did survive, and almost ten thousand years later, Hundro Moritani of House Moritani, found out during the War of Assassins of 10,187 AG, that he and his family were secret long-distant offspring of House Tantor. Soon after, the bitter recently childless Moritani, lost the War to House Ecaz and House Atreides, he confronted his times' current Corrino Emperor Shaddam IV, and revealed his ancestry. He then revealed he was going to repeat the ways of House Tantor, and use nuclear weapons to kill everyone assembled on recent battle plain on planet Grumman.\n\nShaddam, uncaring, sentenced him to be incarcerated; and sent Hundro on a prison frigate in a heighliner, back to Kaitain. Moritani then mysteriously died as his frigate de-pressurized killing him, the last known descendant of House Tantor."

EMPIRE_DESIGN_ordos:0 "House Ordos"
EMPIRE_DESIGN_ordos_desc:0 "House Ordos was a mercantile Great House whose home was an ice-covered planet, Sigma Draconis 4, in the Sigma Draconis star system. House Ordos was most famous for its smuggling of forbidden Ixian technologies into their home planet, and for the wealth that makes them paranoid, but powerful.\n\nOrdos seemed to have formed by a reclusive cartel of wealthy noblemen who seem to control the finances of House Ordos, and thus, House Ordos itself. No one has ever seen them except the few generals who formerly controlled what troops the Ordos could muster.\n\nOne by one, those noblemen generals have been eliminated under mysterious circumstances and were replaced by the Executrix whose origins are not known."

EMPIRE_DESIGN_albans:0 "House Albans"
EMPIRE_DESIGN_albans_desc:0 "Gilbertus Albans (1192 AG-1294 AG) was a Septimian philosopher and logician of interstellar repute, who conceived the program of far-reaching importance, the Mentats. One spring morning in 1231 AG during some leisure-time reading on the Butlerian Jihad, it occurred to Albans that the legendary computers had been built by humans, and it seemed unlikely to him that they had possessed capacities beyond those of the trained human mind. Over the next few years, he devised a plan of study for the production of human computers, which he named Mentats, and recruited students for the program.\n\nA Mentat was a profession or discipline that was developed as a replacement to the computers and thinking machines following the Butlerian Jihad that banned the creation of machines in the human mind's image, just as the Spacing Guild and the Bene Gesserit took up similar functions.\n\nThe name 'Mentat' is derived from mentis, meaning 'of the mind' in Latin, an ancient Terran language. The founder of the Order of Mentats, a logician and philosopher of interstellar repute coined the term to refer to those fully trained and proficient in the techniques he prescribed for the Order."

START_SCREEN_dune:0 "A beginning is a very delicate time. It is the year 10191 and known universe is ruled by the Padisha Emperor Shaddam IV, my father. In this time, the most precious substance in the Universe is the spice. It extends life. It expands consciousness. It is vital to space travel. \n\nThe Spacing Guild and its navigators, who the spice has mutated over four-thousand years, use the orange spice gas, which gives them the ability to fold space, to travel to any part of the Universe without moving. \n\nThe spice exists on only one desolate, dry planet with vast deserts. Hidden away within the rocks are a people known as the Fremen, who have long held a prophecy, that a messiah would lead them to true freedom. This planet is Arrakis, also known as Dune. \n\nPrinces Irulan"

START_SCREEN_dune_fremen:0 "The Fremen are a group of humans native to the planet Arrakis.  They are the descendants of the Zensunni Wanderers who traveled the imperium for millennia, eventually settling on the desert world of Dune.  Surrouned by the most precious substance in the universe, the Spice Melange, the Fremen instead value water above all else."

sr_spice:0 "Spice Melange"
sr_spice_desc:1 "The Spice Melange, commonly referred to simply as 'the spice', is a naturally produced awareness spectrum narcotic that forms a fundamental block of commerce and technological development in the known universe. It also plays an important role in travel and cultural development.\n\nSpice exists on only one planet in the known universe, Arrakis, making this planet a uniquely important and highly contested resource."

sr_truthsayers:0 "Truthsayers"
sr_truthsayers_desc:1 "Truthsaying is a skill developed and used by the Bene Gesserit. Indeed, the majority of Truthsayers employed during the time of the Faufreluches were Bene Gesserit adepts. According to legend humanity's quest for truth before the Jihad had degenerated into a passion for accumulating and storing facts and data. This obsessive activity was encouraged and implemented by the machine mentality which dominated the times. With machines for testing veracity, men no longer searched within themselves for the eternal verities, the reality behind the illusion that is the phenomenal universe. In reaction to this soul-parching tendency, the Holy Council of Nine was formed as a sacred body of Reverend Mothers whose command of truthtrance imbued them with the power of Truthsayers."

sr_sardaukar:0 "Imperial Sardaukar"
sr_sardaukar_desc:1 "The Sardaukar are an elite military force controlled by the Padishah Emperor. They are renowned and feared throughout the Known Universe for their fanatical fighting abilities, and use ruthlessness, cruel and deceitful measures to accomplish their goals. They are also used as "peacekeeping" troops by Shaddam Corrino IV on various missions throughout the galaxy, espcially between House Ecaz and House Moritani."

sr_guild:0 "3rd Stage Navigators"
sr_guild_desc:1 "A Guild Navigator is a senior rank of drastically spice altered humans within the Spacing Guild, and for many Guildsmen the pinnacle of their ambitions. Mutated through the consumption of and exposure to massive amounts of the spice Melange, Navigators are able to use a mentally conditioned and trained form of prescience to safely navigate interstellar and galactic space in long range starships called Heighliners. Failed navigators either die or are heavily deformed and form the administration for the Guilds operations."

sr_swordmasters:0 "Swordmasters of Ginaz"
sr_swordmasters_desc:1 "Swordmaster is a title awarded to warriors attaining a certain level of skill in the Ginaz School, during the time of the Faufreluches. The name 'Swordmaster' comes from the fact that adepts are highly skilled in bladed weapons (namely knives and swords) and hand-to-hand combat, which re-entered human warfare after shielding systems made the use of guns futile."

sr_suk:0 "Suk Doctors"
sr_suk_desc:1 "Suk Doctors or graduates of the Suk School are the pre-eminent physicians of the Known Universe. They are highly valued for their advanced knowledge and for the mental conditioning which prevents any betrayal of patients or the possibility of taking human life. Since it would appear that Suk doctors were only ever in the employ of wealthy families and organisations, it could be assumed that their services came at a high price. Moreover, their conditioning against taking human life was of particular importance for Great Houses and other high-profile organisations, as there would be no chance of Suk doctors ever being used as assassins."

sr_elacca:0 "Elacca Wood"
sr_elacca_desc:1 "Elacca wood is a plant native to the planet Ecaz. It is a blood-grained wood that could be burned to gain a narcotic effect, the Elacca Drug."

sr_mentats:0 "Mentat Advisors"
sr_mentats_desc:1 "Mentats were used extensively by the Great Houses, primarily as political advisors before the rise of God Emperor Leto Atreides II to the throne. Thanks to their vast memories and ability to organize huge amounts of data they often provided valuable insights that would otherwise be lost. Limited Mentat training was also used to augment individuals destined for other political or military roles."

sr_ixian:0 "Ixian Technology"
sr_ixian_desc:1 "Ixian devices are commonplace and considered essential by many factions in the Landsraad, although they sometimes test the limits of the anti-technology proscriptions of the Butlerian Jihad, humanity's crusade against computers, thinking machines, and conscious robots."

sr_tleilaxu:0 "Tleilaxu Technology"
sr_tleilaxu_desc:1 "Tleilaxu technology includes Axlotl Tanks, Face Dancers, Gholas, and Twisted Mentats. It was widely thought that the Tleilaxu ran vast organ farms, growing body parts from viable cells, which they sold during wartime to the battlefield surgeons. The truth, however, was that most of the organs were taken from what the Tleilaxu considered useless slaves. Some of these useless slaves turned out to be wounded soldiers."

They are first encountered through their student, Wellington Yueh."

The Nine were to investigate the nature of humankind continuously, its customs, practices, societies, passions, weaknesses, and instincts, as well as to assess its cosmic destiny. To realize so monumental a task, each member of the Council of Nine had to have concentrated imagination, audacious conception, savage intention, unbridled psychic sensitivity, and iron will, qualifications then tempered and honed to suit the objectives of the Council."

She served as Truthsayer to the Emperor Shaddam IV which offered her a unique, even inspired, vantage point from which to consider the office, function, purpose, and value of her office. The treatise she wrote on the subject was respected, above all, for the authoritative simplicity and elegance of its style and the humility of tone it exhibited in its treatment of so exalted a subject."

However, it is known that the role of Guild Navigator was most prestigious, and the ambition of almost all of those who joined the Guild. Other known Guild roles included the Chief Administrator, the administrative staff, Navigator attendants, Guild ambassadors, and technical support staff."
